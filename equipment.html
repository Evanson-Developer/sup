	<h3>Fitness & Fun Factor</h3>
<p>It's hard to describe in one word what Stand Up Paddling does for you. It is like a pilates workout,
while you feel as though you are "walking on water". When you are done, your core has been
exercised like never before and you feel like your body is properly tied together from head to toe.
You could paddle everyday and not get bored as you are observing marine life while going on a trip,
and not at all like being on a treadmill. It just seems to make sense. And depending on your speed
between leisure and sprint, paddling burns from 250 to 600 calories per hour! It's a great way to get fit
and it's an exceptional crossover training sport for everything you do.</p>

<h3>Quality Equipment</h3

><p>Although equipment alone will not make you a five-star paddler, in this sport more than others, the
right board will make the difference between making your experience a total success or failure.
Quality equipment is key; and the incorrect equipment will absolutely kill the SUP buzz.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that if you try to learn on the incorrect board you may not find comfort and balance.
And if you fall prey to someone who insists that you start on the wrong board, tiny boat wakes, small
chop or even slight wind could become such challenge that it increases the possibility that you will not
enjoy your first experience making it more likely that you might give up. Wherever you go to SUP, be
sure to use quality equipment and proper instruction so that your experience is a success and you do
not miss out on the best new fitness sport of our time.</p>
